CHAPTER 1. Conceptual and Case Analysis Frameworks for Financial Reporting

5. Property, plant, and equipment—impairment

Hyde provides the following information with respect to each of these accounting differences.

Future Income Taxes
Hyde has been using the taxes payable method of reporting income taxes. Accordingly, it reported only the tax
payable in the current year based on income tax laws and did not report any future income taxes assets or liabilities.
Under IFRS, it would have reported deferred income tax liabilities of $190,000 at the end of Year 2 and $220,000 at
the end of Year 3 along with a deferred income tax expense of $30,000 for Year 3.

Property, Plant, and Equipment—Measurement Subsequent to Initial Recognition
Hyde acquired equipment at the beginning of Year 2 at a cost of $250,000. The equipment has an estimated useful
life of 10 years and an estimated residual value of $50,000, and is being depreciated on a straight-line basis. At
the end of Year 2 and end of Year 3, the equipment was appraised and determined to have a fair value of $320,000
and $330,000, respectively; its estimated useful life and residual value did not change. When Hyde adopts IFRS, it
would use the allowed alternative treatment in IAS 16 to periodically revalue the equipment at fair value subsequent
to acquisition. The revaluation surplus goes through OCI.

Research and Development Costs

Hyde incurred research and development costs of $100,000 in Year 3 and $250,000 prior to Year 3. Of these
amounts, the $60,000 in Year 3 and $41,000 prior to Year 3 related to development activities after the point in time
when the criteria for capitalization of development costs had been met. At the end of Year 3, development of the
new product had not been completed, Hyde has been expensing all research and development costs as incurred, as
allowed under ASPE.

Compound Financial Instrument
On January 1, Year 3, Hyde issued convertible debt for proceeds of $310,000. The debt can be converted to com-
mon shares on or before December 31, Year 7. Otherwise, the principal amount of the debt, $300,000, is due on
December 31, Year 8. Interest of $18,000 is due on December 31 each year. Hyde reported $300,000 of the pro-
ceeds as long-term debt and $10,000 as contributed surplus, and expensed the interest payment when it was paid at
the end of the year. Under IFRS, the proceeds should have been broken down to debt of $290,000 and contributed
surplus of $20,000. The discount on the debt would be amortized using the effective interest method, which would
have resulted in an additional interest expense of $760 for Year 3.

Property, Plant, and Equipment—Impairment

Hyde owns machinery on December 31, Year 3, with a carrying amount of $200,000, an estimated salvage
value of $20,000, and an estimated remaining useful life of 10 years. On that date, there is an indication that the
machinery may be impaired. The machinery is expected to generate future cash flows of $225,000 and has an
estimated fair value, after deducting costs to sell, of $180,000. The present value of expected future cash flows
is $186,000.

Required
Prepare a schedule reconciling ASPE profit and ASPE shareholders’ equity to an IFRS basis. Ignore income taxes on all
items except for the future income tax item.
