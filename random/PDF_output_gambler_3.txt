While other kids my age were reading about Tom Sawyer and Huck
Finn, I was living a real-life version of their Tagtag adventures, Like
Mark Twain's fictional characters, I was hustling and hunting for
money because I thought it would solve my problems,

I mowed lawns. I delivered newspapers. And then I added;
third enterprise—a shoeshine stand—on the Hart County court
house square. My customers were mostly farmers who brought their
families into town on Saturdays to shop. Their footwear was caked
with cow shit, chicken shit, and shit I didn’t care to identify, so my
services were in demand.

I charged ten cents a shine and put on quite a show, snappilg
rags until they popped and finishing in a flourish by buffing boo®
with a spit polish. Between shines, I'd join a group of courte
regulars who shot craps in the public bathroom. I usually ..
to lose all or most of my day’s earnings, which became a pattern

Ot my losses were at the hands of a huckster know?

ever we played. Craps. High Dice. Low Dice. It didn’t matter. I
thought I was just unlucky until the day Dandy bounced a pair of
dice off a wall, and they only showed fives, aces, and treys.

Even at a tender age, I knew that something was up. I eventually
figured out that when Dandy blew on his dice, he switched out the
legit set for a pair of smaller “loaded dice” known as “Pee Wees””
which he conveniently kept tucked in the corner of his mouth so he
could consistently roll the same odd numbers.

I never shot craps with him again. But that didn’t stop me from
pitching pennies with him in the men’s room for hours on end. He
couldn’t cheat in that game.

Gambling was simply a way of life in Kentucky. My friends bet
ona daily basis as naturally as they ate supper. We played cards, shot
pool, pitched pennies, shot dice, and wagered on racehorses and
sports. Basically, we'd bet on anything that moved. We never gavea
thought to gambling being immoral or illegal.

Growing up around Munfordville Baptist Church, I learned
that some folks considered gambling to be evil. During Sunday and
Wednesday evening sermons, the preachers scolded the congrega-
tion for engaging in life’s pleasures, be it gambling, dancing, or pre-
marital sex.

Frankly, I never bought a word of it.

When I turned thirteen, Grandmother became so ill that she
couldn’t care for me any longer. I found refuge in the arms of my
aunt Nell, who was slowly dying of emphysema. Aunt Nell did the
best she could, but I was essentially on my own for a couple of years
before she passed on. At fifteen, I had no choice but to leave a place
where I knew everybody and everybody knew me, to live with my
mother and her latest partner in Louisville.

For me, moving out of Munfordville to the largest city in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky was like moving from Mayberry
R.ED. to New York City. And my mom didn’t exactly live in a Park
Avenue co-op.
